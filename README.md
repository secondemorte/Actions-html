This script is currently in improvment, I will update the content until I'm satisfied with the script for a daily use.
If any question feel free to reach me.

**Needs** : Python installed on your computer
**Copy the actions.py in the same folder as actions.html**
Compile actions.py this way : python actions.py (or python3 actions.py if you are using python3)
Once compiled, the python script will write actions.html and open it on your default web browser
